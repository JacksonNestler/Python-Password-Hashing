<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The objective of this script is to have a text file imported and then have each individual line of the text file hashed using a variety of algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512. This information is then written to a text file of its own.</p>
<p>Functionality can be expected to work 100% of the time. All inputs are valid and hashed accordingly. The script processed through a 1GB file of a significant portion of the English language in approximately 7 minutes, a respectable time for a Python script. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Simply download and execute this file. You must have hashlib installed, which comes prepackaged with Python.</p>
